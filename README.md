# DCSC-Projects

Hye everyone. The first project we will be starting is the Weather App. The Project Manager (PM) for this one is Minh. 
The main idea behind this project is that we will create a app that collects the data necessary from a source and places it into our app, 
which will have a basic GUI interface. This project should be fairly simply, but we should be able to use this to improve our Java skills
and develop our Github skills.
